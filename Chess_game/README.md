This project was originally developed by someone else and found on GitHub. I have added new features to enhance its functionality. The game allows the player to choose between playing against an engine or another player. In two-player mode, all standard chess rules are implemented except for en passant. When playing against the engine, the AI does not follow human-like strategies; instead, it prioritizes capturing pieces whenever possible.
